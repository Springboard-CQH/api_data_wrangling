# api_data_wrangling

For this mini project, we will focus on equities data from the Frankfurt Stock Exhange (FSE), which is available for free. We'll try and analyze the stock prices of a company called 
Carl Zeiss Meditec, which manufactures tools for eye examinations, as well as medical lasers for laser eye surgery: https://www.zeiss.com/meditec/int/home.html. The company is listed 
under the stock ticker AFX_X.

You can find the detailed Nasdaq Data API instructions here: https://docs.data.nasdaq.com/docs/in-depth-usage

While there is a dedicated Python package for connecting to the Nasdaq API, we would prefer that you use the requests package, which can be easily downloaded using pip or conda. You can 
find the documentation for the package here: http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/
